3 : Clearly major background for most of the PAGs, for sure need to do, but needs some time to think about modeling of the MC samples 

2 : Possible to do but needs some time to think about modeling of the MC samples (+ have other samples with different generator or binnings as alternatives in block 3 or 4) 

1 : Possible to do but needs some extensive time to think about modeling of the MC samples

0 : Modeling of the MC samples is too delicate to be handled by non-actual-analyzers or have relatively smaller cross sections compare to other processes in the list.
